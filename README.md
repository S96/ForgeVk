# ForgeVk - Spencer Albin
Vulkan renderer developed to learn advanced graphics techniques in professional pipelines. 
Hopefully it will be usable to power games, engines, and other graphical programs, but it's not my primary goal.

External Dependencies:
- GLM - math library
- GLFW - cross platform window support
- LunarG - Base Vulkan API
